# screentime
Personal project used for understanding how to interact with Chrome APIs and how chrome extensions worked. Takes advantage of chrome's tabs api to query for site information and the localstorage api to save/query screentime info so that usage can be stored over time. Uses ReactJS to create a small chart in the corner of the screen once the extension is clicked that shows screentime of specified sites (e.g. youtube).
